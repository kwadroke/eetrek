## Important

A new Pre-Release version has changed the way that theming/mods work. Create a new branch for Pre-Release then merge into Main after Pre-release moves to Release.

## Next Steps

- Replace Sounds
- Fix font loading. 
  - For now have to replace fonts in options.ini
- Add Ship Models
- Replace Ship Radar Textures


## Maybe to do?

- add CC0 Music ?

## DONE

- Fix Helm, science, etc KeyValue boxes. 
  - A work-around has been used KeyValue until [#1681](https://github.com/daid/EmptyEpsilon/issues/1681) has been fixed.
